1. Overall (1 main plot)
- Overall line plot (and button to change to 1min, 5min, 15min, 1h)
- Average hit ratio/ error rate per interval (also plot in 1 lineplot)

2. Detail
- Top 10 domains that send most request
- Top 10 File types 
- Top active IPs
- Mean hits/ file size/ % Success rate in 1 day

3. Hypothesis

- Traffic follows a cycle with pattern
- High traffic IP occurs at specific time in a day/ month
- High frequency -> large file size, or vice versa, or no relation
